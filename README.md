## Title and Purpose
Package Delivery Routing Program <br>
Purpose: Build a greedy algorithm that delivers 40 packages. There were 3 main contraints : total miles traveled, truck capacity limit, delivery time


The shortest path algorithm implemented in this program was a greedy algorithm known as nearest neighbor. The main data structures used in this project were hash tables. Hash tables were used to store the data from the csv files for both package and distance information. 

## Built With
Python 3.6.2 <br>
PyCharm Community Edition 2020.3.3 (IDE)
